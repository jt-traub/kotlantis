# Lemuria
Lemuria is a re-implemenation of the [Atlantis](https://github.com/Atlantis-PBEM/Atlantis) PBeM game
engine in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org)

The name Lemuria was chosen as it, like Atlantis, is a sunken island of yore.

The intent is for this to be a report-format / order-format compatible reimplmentation of the
code being used for Atlantis New Origins V5 (and newer).
